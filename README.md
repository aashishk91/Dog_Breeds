An exciting Python project where I scraped data from the Kennel Club's dog breed site and created detailed visual insights on dog breed characteristics! üê∂
Utilized BeautifulSoup for web scraping, gathering breed names, characteristics, and breed groups.
Generated interactive data visualizations using Matplotlib to show distribution, lifespan, exercise needs, and grooming requirements for each breed group.
A great exercise in data extraction, transformation, and visualization!
